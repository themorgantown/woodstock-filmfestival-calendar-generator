## What is this?

This repository automatically reads the [Woodstock Film Festival website](https://woodstockfilmfestival.org) to generate a comprehensive calendar file (.ics) containing all festival events. The calendar includes:

- Event titles and descriptions
- Screening times and dates
- Venue locations
- Direct links to event details

## Slow scraper

This scraper does not use more than a single-person's bandwidth. It is intentionally slow to avoid overloading the festival's website.


## Updates

The calendar is automatically updated every 6 hours via GitHub Actions. Check back regularly for the latest schedule updates.

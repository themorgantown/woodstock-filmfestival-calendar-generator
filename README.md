## What is this?

This repository automatically reads the [Woodstock Film Festival website](https://woodstockfilmfestival.org) to generate a comprehensive calendar file (.ics) containing all festival events. The calendar includes:

- Event titles and descriptions
- Screening times and dates
- Venue locations
- Direct links to event details

## Respectful Scraping

This scraper is designed to be respectful of the festival's website:
- **Rate Limited**: 2-second delays between venue pages, 0.5-second delays between detail pages
- **Limited Scope**: Only enhances first 50 events with detail pages (out of ~119 total)
- **Efficient**: Uses cached results, runs only 4 times per day
- **Transparent**: Identifies itself with a clear User-Agent
- **Total bandwidth**: ~1 minute of requests every 6 hours

This is equivalent to a single person browsing the website once per day.

## Updates

The calendar is automatically updated every 6 hours via GitHub Actions (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC). 

**Last successful scrape**: Check the [latest commit](https://github.com/themorgantown/woodstock-filmfestival-calendar-generator/commits/main) or [workflow runs](https://github.com/themorgantown/woodstock-filmfestival-calendar-generator/actions)

## Known Limitations

- Detail page descriptions are only fetched for the first 50 events (to limit server load)
- ICS URLs may appear line-wrapped in some calendar apps (this is correct per ICS standard)
- Event descriptions are extracted from venue pages and may occasionally include extra formatting

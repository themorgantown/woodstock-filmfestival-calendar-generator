DESCRIPTION:Prevailing narratives in today’s film industry suggest that 
 you can only sell a documentary film or series about true crime or a major
  celebrity. So how are we defining success in the U.S. documentary industr
 y in 2025? The nonfiction world is shifting fast: public funding is disapp
 earing\, documentary theatrical releases face headwinds\, and filmmakers a
 re being pushed to deliver stories that are both urgent and entertaining.\
 n\nBut success doesn’t look the same for everyone. It might mean sparkin
 g cultural impact\, fueling social change\, reaching underserved audiences
 \, or simply building a sustainable career. This conversation asks what su
 ccess really means for documentary today – and how redefining it on our 
 own terms can help shape a more resilient\, relevant\, and enduring future
  for nonfiction.\n\nPanelists:Geeta Gandbhir\, Julie Goldman\, Sabrina Sc

DESCRIPTION:Co-presented by NYWIFT\n\nThroughout history\, creators have f
 aced the challenge of industry and government censorship\, with authoritie
 s attempting to control the narratives and themes presented on screen. Des
 pite these restrictions\, many filmmakers have bravely pushed the boundari
 es of artistic expression\, using their work to highlight social and polit
 ical issues\, and advocate for freedom of speech. Storytellers have subver
 ted such restrictions using techniques like metaphor or allegory\, contrib
 uting to the evolution of the medium and preserving cultural heritage.\n\n
 The panel will bring together documentary and narrative filmmakers with in
 dustry leaders to discuss the complex interplay between artistic freedom a
 nd societal values\, in both a historical and contemporary context.\n\nPan

DESCRIPTION:Finely-crafted and distinctive narrative and documentary short
 s from up and coming visionary film school students.\n\nFilms Showing:\n\n
 Dawn's World\nA lonely gallery docent consults the imaginary creatures in 
 her head when she learns that a fellow docent is getting fired. Should she
  talk to him? Or remain solitary forever?\n\nHow I Learned to Die\n16-year
 -old Iris finds out she has a 60% chance of dying in four days from a high
 -risk surgery… so now she's gotta live it up. Chasing a wild bucket-list
 \, she makes unexpected discoveries along the way.\n\nAre You Having Fun?\
 nUnemployed Ava has planned a fun bachelorette party weekend in Miami for 
 her picture-perfect best friend\, Kendall. But when Kendall's party and Av
 a's job prospects come in conflict with each other\, Ava tests just how fa
 r she is willing to go for her friend to have a good time.\n\nHotspot\nA s
 poiled city teen is dragged upstate for spring break with his dad and his 
 dad's new girlfriend as they renovate their Airbnb. But when he meets a tr
 oubled local with a history of arson\, an unexpected common ground is form
 ed.\n\nSt. Joe's Hoes\nFour young women\, a dancer\, a painter\, a photogr
 apher\, and a writer\, come to New York City from different parts of the w
 orld with suitcases full of hope and a single address just blocks from Tim
 es Square: a former convent converted into affordable housing for nearly 8
 0 women. In tight communal spaces\, from a rat-prone kitchen to a stained-
 glass chapel and clogged bathrooms\, the women forge unlikely bonds while 
 navigating personal struggles\, creative ambition\, and the shared audacit
 y of "making it" in New York. Set in a time just before current shifts in 
 immigration and international student policies\, the film captures their r
 esilience and precarity.\n\nThe Wrath of Othell-Yo!\nOn the set of the ero
 tic blaxploitation film The Wrath of Othell-Yo\, Tommy\, the black product
 ion assistant\, replaces the lead actor of the film who fails to get erect
  and finds himself thrust into a racialized Othello pastiche that becomes 
 more than he bargained for.

 earing\, documentary theatrical releases face headwinds\, and filmmakers a
 re being pushed to deliver stories that are both urgent and entertaining.\

 g cultural impact\, fueling social change\, reaching underserved audiences
 \, or simply building a sustainable career. This conversation asks what su
